## Technical Details
We built a Webapp on the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) Framework. It provides a simple layout which we only had to adapt a little to our preferences. 
Streamlit is also very good for additional adding of ML-Models/Ai integration for the future. 

Our product actually consists of two Webapps: One for the user/employee filing a case and one for the manager/person to resolve and handle the case. 
Both are connected via a database containing all the complaints and a chat database for each case. 

### Folder Structure: 
- Each webapp has a subfolder in /frontend. In it is one launch file containing the landing page as well as other pages in the /pages folder.
- Databases and PDFs are stored in the /data folder.
- additional setup and design files are needed in various locations.
